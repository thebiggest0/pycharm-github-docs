# Overview of Version Control and PyCharm User Guide

Welcome, first-term CST students! As you begin your exciting journey in the world of programming, this guide is here to assist you with the initial setups of PyCharm and GitHub, which are essential tools for your COMP 1510 Procedural Programming course.

These are the topics of this document:
- GitHub Setup
- PyCharm Installation
- Connect PyCharmm to Github

## How We Collaborated Together

This project was a collaborative effort. Building upon our team's experience from previous projects, we leveraged our understanding of individual strengths and communication styles to work effectively. Development occurred on the main branch, with each team member focusing on their assigned areas while actively communicating via Discord to solve problems and share ideas.

## How We Created Our Guide

This guide was created based on official user guides from [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/quick-start-guide.html) and [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account). We summarized key information and included solutions to common difficulties we faced during PyCharm and GitHub setup, aiming to make the process smoother for others.

This was our first time using Markdown to create content for a website. We built the website using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as our IDE and employed MkDocs as our static site generator. MkDocs's built-in functionality simplified the process, allowing us to focus on developing quality content rather than website styling.

## What We Learned

This project taught us the importance of audience focus. We learned to present technical information by breaking down complex procedures to individual steps.
